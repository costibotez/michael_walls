Please read these terms and conditions carefully before placing an order with Michael Walls. By placing an order with the website, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these terms and conditions.
<h2>1. Your Details</h2>
When you register with the website, you will be required to choose a contact email address and password. You are responsible for all sessions and transactions taken under these details. You should keep your password safe and not disclose it to anyone. You should change it immediately if you feel it has been compromised.
<h2>2. Our Contract</h2>
Your order is an offer to buy the book(s) or other products in your order. When you place an order we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is an acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the book(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a book ordered by you, when we dispatch the book to you and send an e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the book to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). Your contract is with Michael Walls. Without affecting your right of cancellation set out in section 3 below, you can cancel your order for a book at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that book.

You consent to receive sales invoices electronically.
<h2>3. Return of Goods</h2>
Please send the items to the address below and enclose the despatch email showing your order number.

For the return of high-value goods, we recommend that you use a recorded delivery service, as we cannot be responsible for non-delivery of returned items.
